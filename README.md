# What is this?

This package takes as an option a directory from Adobe Animate containing images, js, and HTML and converts the directory into a single HTML file named 'publish_index.html' whitch is inserted into the original dir. The output file will have all js fill added to the head of 'publish_index.html' and the image files will be converted to base64. The file conversion will allow the file to run in a closed environment.
